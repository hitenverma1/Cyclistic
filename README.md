# Cyclistic (Capstone Project)
I collected 12 months cycling trips data set of this bike sharing company "Cyclistic"

Cyclistic is a fictional company that Google designed for this case study,
but the dataset used is real-world trip data under this license ( https://lnkd.in/ghHyeVN6 ). The data is owned by The City of Chicago.

The business task to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

I learn a lot through this project as it completes the whole process of data analysis from collecting raw data to cleaning data, then to visualizing and at last building business reports.
