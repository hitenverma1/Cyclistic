# Cyclistic
I collected 12 months cycling trips data set of this bike sharing company "Cyclistic"

Cyclistic is a fictional company that Google designed for this case study,
but the dataset used is real-world trip data under this license ( https://lnkd.in/ghHyeVN6 ). The data is owned by The City of Chicago.

The business task itself is to identify the differences between casual riders and annual members of how they used Cyclistic Bike-Share for determining marketing strategy.

I learn a lot through this project as it completes the whole process of data analysis from collecting raw data to cleaning data, then to visualizing and at last building business reports.
